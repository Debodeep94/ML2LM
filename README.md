# ML2LM

Welcome to our channel, ML2LM. This repository will provide you the codes for the topics that we discuss on our youtube channel. We will sequentially update this repository based on the topics that we cover.

## Topics.
    
### 1. Python Basics 
#### 1.1 Data types and Operators. [Code](https://github.com/Debodeep94/ML2LM/blob/main/python_basics/data_types_and_operators.ipynb)
        *Visit python_basic/data_types_and_operators.ipynb for codes.*
        ``` What Are Data Types? <br>
                Data types define the kind of value a variable can hold in a programming language. In Python, every piece of data (like numbers, text or a collection of items) has a specific data type that tells Python how to process and store that data. <br>

                Some examples: <br>
                Text like "Python" is a `str` (string).<br>
                An integer like 7 is an `int` datatype while a decimal like 7.7 is a `float`. <br>
                A value like `True` or `False` is a `bool` (boolean).<br>
                <br>

                #### Dynamic Typing in Python
                One of Python's strengths is dynamic typing, which means you donâ€™t need to declare the type of a variable explicitly like java or C++. Python automatically determines the type of a variable based on the value you assign to it.<br>
                <br>
                We can use the `type()` function to check the data type of a variable.```
